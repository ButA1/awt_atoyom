# Non-Issue:

    - level geometry was translated correctly
    - the door was translated correctly

# Issue:

    - window prefab completely broken
    - lighting completely broken
    - all enemies are missing
    - of cause all the game logic is missing

# Solution:

    - rebuild window prefab, along with the [particle system](porting_particle_system.md) idk why this link does not working a list
    - adding lambert only onmilight for now

# Personal notes

    - I do not yet undestand how the unity scene is lit, even with lambert the godot scene looks off
