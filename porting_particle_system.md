Issue:

    - imported particle node seems completely broken
    - there are pro builder scripts in the Unity version that reshape the window from a cube into a plane

Solution:

    - not gonna sugarcoat it: I gotta rebuild the whole effect

Personal notes:

    - find out how to do particles in Godot
    - see if any settings made it over from Unity, even if they aren't configured properly
    - I probably have to remodel the window, but honestly this shouldn't be so bad
    - seems like the Unity setting only survived as a "dictionary" and are basically useless
