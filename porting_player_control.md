# Issues

- Since mechanics of GDScript and Godot engine very different, nothing can be auto-imported and most things have to be done from scratch

# Outstanding problems

- Relative movement is broken [not sure why]
- floating mechanics during slowmotion still outstanding issue
- capture and shoot mechanics not implemented


# Notes

- GDScript very straight forward, similar to Python
- player movement and input capture is much more intuitive to implement in Godot than in Unity
- how to stop the mouse from existing the screen?
